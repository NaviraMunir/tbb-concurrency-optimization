# Optimizing Multithreaded Queues with Intel¬Æ TBB

*A practical guide to lock-free, scalable data structures and allocators in modern C++*

---

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to drastically improve performance in multithreaded systems using **Intel¬Æ oneTBB (Threading Building Blocks)** ‚Äî a C++ library providing **high-performance concurrent containers, task scheduling**, and **a scalable memory allocator**.

In our real-world use case, a high-throughput packet processing service suffered performance degradation during traffic bursts because multiple threads contended on shared queues. After integrating **TBB‚Äôs lock-free structures and scalable allocator**, we reduced peak packet processing latency from **1000 ms to just 50 ms**, achieving **up to 20√ó faster performance** under load.

## Why TBB?

Traditional concurrency often relies on `std::mutex` or `std::lock_guard` to protect shared data.
However, as thread counts grow, **global locks become bottlenecks** ‚Äî introducing contention, context switching, and cache invalidation.

**Intel oneTBB** addresses this through:

1. **Fine-grained sharding and internal concurrency**
   Containers such as `tbb::concurrent_queue` and `tbb::concurrent_unordered_map` use internal shards guarded by lightweight locks or atomics, enabling multiple threads to operate simultaneously.

2. **Scalable memory allocation**
   `tbb::scalable_allocator` avoids the global heap lock of `malloc/new` by maintaining per-thread memory pools and a *remote free list* for safe cross-thread deallocations.

3. **Task-based parallelism**
   TBB‚Äôs scheduler automatically distributes tasks across cores ‚Äî improving CPU utilization and reducing idle time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install TBB

**Ubuntu / Debian**

```bash
sudo apt install libtbb-dev
```

**Fedora / CentOS**

```bash
sudo dnf install tbb-devel
```

**CMake Example**

```cmake
find_package(TBB REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE TBB::tbb)
```

## üß† Example 1: Replacing a Locked Queue

### üß± Before (mutex-protected queue)

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <mutex>

std::queue<int> q;
std::mutex q_mtx;

void producer() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(q_mtx);
        q.push(i);
    }
}

void consumer() {
    while (true) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(q_mtx);
        if (!q.empty()) q.pop();
    }
}
```

üî¥ *Under load, threads constantly wait for each other, leading to latency spikes.*

---

### ‚ö° After (lock-free queue)

```cpp
#include <tbb/concurrent_queue.h>

tbb::concurrent_queue<int> cq;

void producer() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
        cq.push(i);
}

void consumer() {
    int value;
    while (cq.try_pop(value)) {
        // process(value);
    }
}
```

‚úÖ Lock-free and wait-free operations
‚úÖ Scales linearly with CPU cores
‚úÖ Drastically reduced thread contention

---

## üß† Example 2: Using a Scalable Allocator

### Before

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> logs;
```

### After

```cpp
#include <tbb/scalable_allocator.h>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<std::string, tbb::scalable_allocator<std::string>> logs;
```

‚úÖ Each thread gets its own memory pool
‚úÖ Eliminates global heap locks
‚úÖ Lower fragmentation and better cache locality

## ‚öñÔ∏è `malloc` vs `tbb::scalable_allocator`

| Aspect        | malloc / calloc          | TBB scalable_allocator          |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Locking       | Global heap lock         | Per-thread memory pools         |
| Fragmentation | High under concurrency   | Reduced via pooled blocks       |
| Scalability   | Degrades beyond ~4 cores | Scales to 64+ cores             |
| Overhead      | OS-level synchronization | Lightweight atomic coordination |

## üìä Real-World Performance Results

| Metric                            | Before (mutex-based) | After (TBB concurrent + scalable_allocator) |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Avg. packet processing time**   | ~250 ms              | ~25‚Äì35 ms                                   |
| **Peak latency under contention** | ~1000 ms+            | ‚â§ 50 ms                                     |
| **CPU utilization**               | 60‚Äì70 %              | 90‚Äì95 %                                     |
| **Heap contention**               | High                 | Negligible                                  |
| **Overall improvement**           | ‚Äì                    | **10‚Äì20√ó faster**                           |

üîç This improvement was observed in a multi-threaded packet-handling service, where multiple threads enqueue and process real-time data concurrently.

## üß© Conclusion

Intel¬Æ oneTBB provides a **modern, high-performance C++ foundation** for parallelism ‚Äî ideal for systems dealing with high data throughput, packet processing, logging, or analytics.

By replacing global locks and traditional heap allocations with **lock-free concurrent containers** and **scalable memory pools**, you can achieve:

* **Near-linear scalability**
* **Drastically reduced contention**
* **Consistent latency even under peak load**

TBB is primarily a **C++ library**, but its concepts (task graphs, work stealing, fine-grained concurrency) have inspired equivalents in other ecosystems ‚Äî e.g., Java‚Äôs `ForkJoinPool` and .NET‚Äôs TPL.
